## Day One : Robots and Masters

**Goals for Today**:

* Explain the relationship between the coder and the computer
* Introduce the three _primitive_ datatypes that will be used during the course: __int__ , __doubles (_float_)__ and __strings__ 
* Introduce the arithmetic operations in Python
* Explain the syntax of variables and its uses

## Coder and Computer
__Activity__: Split that class into teams - where each team preferably has at least __four__ students. 

Have each team designate one of their members to be that team's __robot__. 

Once teams have been set and their robots have been chosen, block the vision of each team's robot using some spare textile or cloth - such as a clean handkerchief or bandanna.

Using the layout of your classroom, set a pathway with a distinct starting and ending location, for the robots to traverse to and from.

The robots may only perform the commands their team says and on their own interpretation.

__Importance__: Students often come into introductory programming classes with the assumption that computers are magical boxes that perform useful tasks. 

The purpose of this activity is to demonstrate that the tasks they see a computer doing had to be __coded / programmed__ by someone. And that all a computer does is execute those tasks as set by that person - the __coder / programmer__ .

__Intended Result__: While the overarching goal of this activity is to demystify the nature of computers for students, it's also a great way to break the ice on the first day.

__Recommended Extensions__ : 

* __Time Analysis__ - It's always good to have a little bit of a competitive spirit. To instill a small degree of that, ask student to measure the speed of their robots. 
	- Tally up the time of each team publicly and ask each team to find ways to improve that time.
* __Language__ - During each team's trial's, most students may be using very ambiguous commands such as _"turn left"_ or _"move forward a few steps"_ , etc. This can cause unintended actions as their robot may not know exactly what their team intends them to do, so they act according to their own interpretation.
	- Create a very small "robot language" for students to use with commands to move forwards and backwards. Teams should then make sure that their robot understands what the intended action is per command.
	- Are these set of commands accurate enough? Does it cover everything that our robot needs to do? (such as turning to a specific direction). Ask them to design their own set of commands for their robots.
	
## Datatypes : Better than 1's and 0's

A computer sees everything as 1's and 0's - as binary. But can you imagine always having to translate numbers to binary? It would be a painful experience!

Luckily, we don't have to! Thanks to **datatypes**, us programmers don't have to worry about having to convert to and from binary.

For this course, we will be using three main datatypes: __int__ , __double__ and __string__

__int__ - Used to represent negative and positive whole numbers, as well as 0.

*Example Integers:* **5** , **0** , **-10**

__double__ - Used to represent negative and positive numbers that have a decimal point, as well as 0.

*Example Doubles:* **5.62** , **0.0** , **-3.14**, **1.24369**

__strings__ - Used to represent a sequence of characters - such as words and phrases. In Python, we have to put strings around quotation marks.

*Example Strings:* **"Hello World!"** , **'I am a programmer'** 

__Questions to Ask__ : 
* What datatype should
* gjgjkg
