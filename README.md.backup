# Five Day Python
An introductory, five day lesson plan for teaching Python and basic network programming

## Summary
The lesson plan is meant to take place in 5-6 days, with each lesson day approximately taking 2-3 hours.

In the course of the lesson plan, students will be introduced to both foundational programming concepts and Python syntax, but also concepts in computer networking by gradually building applications that make use of network communication.

## Structure
Each lesson day puts heavy emphasis on practice questions and having students fill-in provided skeleton code to make use of what they've learned.

There also suggestions for some unplugged activities to further strengthen students' understanding.

## Purpose 
I've developed this lesson plan in my two years teaching Python Programming with Sally Ride Science. One of my first experiences in programming was making a chatbox for two users to communicate over a network - which I thought was a really cool moment for me.

The lesson plan is by no means perfect. Five days aren't enough to fully solidify a student's understanding on a new subject, but I feel that the concepts and projects presented in this lesson plan is a good framework for an introduction. 

## Credits
learpython was a main source of inspiration when making this plan - especially the first three lesson days.
